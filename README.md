# CAPTCHA Plugin #

## Description ##

This plugin provides a CAPTCHA field on subscription forms using the
<a href="https://www.phpcaptcha.org" target="_blank">Secureimage</a> package.

## Installation ##

### Dependencies ###

Requires php version 5.4 or later and the php GD extension to be installed.

Requires the Securimage package to be installed.
Also requires Common Plugin to be installed,  see <https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-common>

### Set the plugin directory ###
You can use a directory outside of the web root by changing the definition of `PLUGIN_ROOTDIR` in config.php.
The benefit of this is that plugins will not be affected when you upgrade phplist.

### Install through phplist ###
Install on the Plugins page (menu Config > Plugins) using the package URL
`https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-captcha/archive/master.zip`

### Install Securimage ###
You also need to install the Securimage package from <https://www.phpcaptcha.org/download/>

Expand the zip file, then copy the securimage directory to your web site.

You need to make a small change to the securimage code which is explained on the documentation page
<https://resources.phplist.com/plugin/captcha#change_to_the_securimage_code>

On the phplist Settings page, in the Captcha section, you must then specify the web path to the securimage directory.
For example, if you copied the Securimage package to the root of your web site then the path would be `/securimage`.

### Usage ###

For advice on configuring and using the plugin see the documentation page <https://resources.phplist.com/plugin/captcha>.
